Here are some practice questions focused on `if` and `if-else` statements in Python:

### Question 1: Odd or Even
Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is odd or even.

### Question 2: Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number and checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Question 3: Largest of Three Numbers
Write a Python program that takes three integers as input and determines the largest of the three numbers.

### Question 4: Leap Year Checker
Write a Python program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400.)

### Question 5: Vowel or Consonant
Write a Python program that takes a single character input from the user and checks if it is a vowel or a consonant. (Consider only lowercase alphabets for simplicity.)

### Question 6: Grading System
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a percentage score and assigns a grade based on the following criteria:
- `90-100`: Grade A
- `80-89`: Grade B
- `70-79`: Grade C
- `60-69`: Grade D
- Below 60: Grade F

### Question 7: Divisibility Check
Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number and checks if the number is divisible by both 5 and 11.

### Question 8: Age Validator
Write a Python program that asks the user to input their age and checks if they are eligible to vote (age 18 and above).

### Question 9: Simple Calculator
Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Use `if-else` statements to perform the operation and print the result.

### Question 10: Check Character Case
Write a Python program that takes a single character input and checks if it is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or neither (e.g., a digit or a special character).
