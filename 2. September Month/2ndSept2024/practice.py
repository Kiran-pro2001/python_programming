number = int(input("Enter a number :"))
print(number )

# 3.4  -- it is giving error

# mistake is...when you are putting 3.4, and it tries to convert to int
# but keep in mind that, only from string to int, the inner value should be int type
# if inner value is float, then we can only convert to float type...no any other data type.


# So it's better use eval function
